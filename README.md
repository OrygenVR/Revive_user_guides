## Introduction
Revive is a novel virtual reality (VR) therapy designed to help young people overcome social anxiety and improve their social interaction skills. By creating immersive, realistic social scenarios in a VR setting, Revive allows individuals to practice and gain confidence in situations they find challenging, such as conversations in a cafe or interactions on public transport. This personalized and interactive approach, guided by therapists, offers a safe and controlled environment for users to develop social skills, making it a valuable complement to traditional therapeutic methods.
